        I'm working as Software Engineer since 2020. In this time I efforted to learn basic architectural structures. Generally I developed `Back-end` but this is not enough for editing to multi-step project therefor
        I involed `Front-End` and `Dev-Ops` to my working area. My most important goal is editing to all steps of any project. I will continue to the studies for this goal.
